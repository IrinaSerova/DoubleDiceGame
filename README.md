## Double Dice Game


### Simple Java program that simulates a dice rolls by scanning an input numbers from 1-6. Compare the two values, determine and display the final scores.
### Each player starts with 100 points. The game uses standard six-sided dice and is played in rounds. During one round, each player rolls one die. The player with the lower roll loses the number of points shown on the higher die.
### If both players roll the same number, no points are lost by either player.
